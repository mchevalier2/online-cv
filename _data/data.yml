    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a palaeoclimatologist focused on the development and application of
      innovative statistical techniques based on the estimation and propagation
      of proxy natural uncertainties to reconstruct climate from extensive
      networks of fossil data. I am particularly interested in studying the
      spatial imprint of climate change in tropical regions on the centennial
      to orbital time scales.
        - Using proxy uncertainties to enhance fossil records.  I believe
        that the natural uncertainties that pertain to all proxy data contain
        critical information that should be used to improve the representativity
        of each palaeoclimatic records in space and time.
        - Integrating large compilations of fossil records.  I am convinced
        that combining independent records together in dedicated frameworks can
        improve the signal-over-noise ratio of individual climate records. There
        is strength in numbers.
        - Understanding climate drivers from tropical regions. I use a 
        large array of state-of-the-art combined data-model assimilation
        approaches to shed light on the dynamical response of broad-scale
        climate drivers to past and future climate change.

      company: Department of Meteorology, University of Bonn, Germany.
      details: |
        A member of the German consortium PALMOD, my role is to develop Bayesian
        statistical models to calculate the Bayes factor of temperature/precipitation
        reconstructions. Once develovelped, use of the tools to analyse the
        PALMOD transient climate simulations.

      company: Institut des dynamiques de la surface terrestre (IDYST), University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
      details: |
        During this postdoc, I worked on a project focused on reconstructing
        Holocene climate across the Northern Hemipshere extratropics (Europe,
        North America, Russia) using extensive collections of fossil pollen data.
          - Data compilation and curation

      company: Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), University of Montpellier, France.
      details: |
        During this postdoc, I developed a relational database of climate records
        from Africa and implemented an R package to query and extract the data
        more easily.

      details: |
        During my PhD, I focused on developing new tools to reconstruct climate
        from pollen data and to employ them on southern African fossil records.
        I also created a point-and-click graphical interface to employ my novel
        statistical tools
