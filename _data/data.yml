career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a palaeoclimatologist focused on the development and application of
      innovative statistical techniques based on the estimation and propagation
      of proxy natural uncertainties to reconstruct climate from extensive
      networks of fossil data. I am particularly interested in studying the
      spatial imprint of climate change in tropical regions on the centennial
      to orbital time scales.

experiences:
    - role: Postdoctoral Researcher
      time: 2020 - Present
      company: Department of Meteorology, University of Bonn, Germany.
      details: |
        A member of the German consortium PALMOD, my role is to develop Bayesian
        statistical models to calculate the Bayes factor of temperature/precipitation
        reconstructions. Once develovelped, use of the tools to analyse the
        PALMOD transient climate simulations.
          - Bayesian statistics
          - Data-model comparison and/or integration
          - Software developments

    - role: Postdoctoral Researcher
      time: 2017 - 2020
      company: Institut des dynamiques de la surface terrestre (IDYST), University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
      details: |
        During this postdoc, I worked on a project focused on reconstructing
        Holocene climate across the Northern Hemipshere extratropics (Europe,
        North America, Russia) using extensive collections of fossil pollen data.
          - Data compilation and curation
          - Methodological developments
          - Databases
          - 'Big' Data Analysis

    - role: Postdoctoral Researcher
      time: 2016
      company: Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), University of Montpellier, France.
      details: |
        During this postdoc, I developed a relational database of climate records
        from Africa and implemented an R package to query and extract the data
        more easily.
          - Databases
          - Software development

    - role: PhD Student
      time: 2012 - 2015
      company: Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier (ISEM), University of Montpellier, France.
      details: |
        During my PhD, I focused on developing new tools to reconstruct climate
        from pollen data and to employ them on southern African fossil records.
        I also created a point-and-click graphical interface to employ my novel
        statistical tools
